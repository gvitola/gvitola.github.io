This is an account where I aim to collect as many pieces of software (useful examples) and guides that could be used by many people (mainly software developers) to update themselves on new tools and programming languages.

It is a big challenge, given the number of current tools and so many programming languages, some for general purpose and others for specific purpose, which is overwhelming for those who, like me, love our career and want to be updated with the latest trends.

For this reason it is not an easy effort to achieve alone, that is why I invite those who want to join this cause to contribute with a brief review of the tool they know, including its most relevant characteristics that make it important and different from others, references to the official documentation and a piece of software that shows in a simple way how to use it and why it should be used, following high programming standards and where you can see its usefulness in practice.
