This is an account where I aim to collect as many pieces of software (useful examples) and guides that could be used by many people (mainly software developers) to update themselves on new tools and programming languages.

It is a big challenge, given the number of current tools and so many programming languages, some for general purpose and others for specific purpose, which is overwhelming for those who, like me, love our career and want to be updated with the latest trends.

For this reason, it is not an easy effort to achieve alone, that is why I invite those who want to join in this cause to contribute to this purpose, with a brief review of the tool, with its most relevant characteristics that make it important, the references to the documentation official of the same and with a piece of software that shows in a simple way how to use it, following high programming standards and that its usefulness can be seen in practice.
