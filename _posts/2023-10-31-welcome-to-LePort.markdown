This is my first post on the home page for the GVitola account on GitHub, that was developed based on the Jekyll tool. 

Following the instructions in the Pages sections of the Setting tab for a GitHub repository, it was very easy to arrive at this initial solution.

In the instructions I followed for its development and deployment, I was able to identify not only a grate tool [Jekyll][jekyll-home] for developing web pages, but also an alternative way to use [Git branches][].

Until now, I had explored the usefulness of branches in collaborative work for the integrity of the solution under pre-established standards of each company. However, on this occasion the use of Git branches is also proposed to address complementary tasks such as solution documentation, promotional and installation pages, among other purposes. Complementary tasks that do not necessarily need to be integrated into the main branch and each of them can be associated with a different destination, as in this case, the page is in the gh-pages branch that is linked to the Jekyll engine to show the page in the browser while the main branch contains all the components of the software being developed.

Now, if it is desired in any case to keep the documentation, the page or any other complementary information integrated into the solution, a protocol can also be established in which the routes where this documentation should be located are defined, such as in a /docs folder, in which case the necessary configurations must be taken into account to associate it with the appropriate repositories, as in this case, as the web page root directory.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
